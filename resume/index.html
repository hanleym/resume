<ul>
<li>Designed and developed a replacement <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a> implementation capable of handling large bursts of traffic.
<ul>
<li>The previous system (a modified open-source solution) was unable to handle the throughput required by our larger customers. The service would run out of memory due to a combination of architecture and memory management oversights, causing outages and incurring considerable costs.</li>
<li>Proposed and led the adoption of Rust for the replacement due to its solid performance and predictable memory management.</li>
<li>Written in Rust, utilizing API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.</li>
<li>Upon release of the project, it handled 2.5 million invocations per day with bursts of over 7 thousand invocations in a one-minute window. Additionally, the serverless architecture isolated issues caused by individual customers and reduced costs by an order of magnitude.</li>
